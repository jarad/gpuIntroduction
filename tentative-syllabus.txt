The following is a tentative list of talks of the gpu computing lecture series:

1. Introduction to GPU Computing
2. Algorithms in gputools (including a review of linear algebra)
3. gputools: usage and performance
4. the WideLM R package: algorithms and usage (and maybe performance)
5. the cudaBayesreg R package: algorithms and usage (and maybe performance)
6. the magma R package: algorithms and usage (and maybe performance)
7. the gcbd R package: algorithms and usage (and maybe performance)
8. Introduction to programming in CUDA C
9. more CUDA C: pairwise summation and simple MC integration
10. more advanced CUDA C topics from the Sanders book
11. CUDA C: a review of algorithms and implementations in recent papers:
  - Anthony Lee's paper on GPU implementations of MC, SMC, and MCMC
  - the Suchard paper on statistical phylogenetics
  - current work on the Cholesky decomposition
12. Matt's talk: gpu model search and/or R extensions to C and CUDA C (whatever makes the most sense to present)
13. Introduction to programming in python.
14. pycuda
15. gpustats
