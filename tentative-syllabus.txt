The following is a tentative list of talks of the gpu computing lecture series:

1. Introduction to GPU Computing
2. Algorithms in gputools (including a review of some topics in linear algebra)
3. gputools: usage and performance
4. Introduction to programming in CUDA C
5. more CUDA C: pairwise summation and simple MC integration
6. more advanced CUDA C topics from the Sanders book (1-2 lectures)
7. CUDA C: a review of algorithms and implementations in recent papers:
  - Anthony Lee's paper on GPU implementations of MC, SMC, and MCMC
  - the Suchard paper on statistical phylogenetics
  - current work on the Cholesky decomposition
8. Matt's talk: gpu model search and/or R extensions to C and CUDA C (whatever makes the most sense to present)
9. Introduction to programming in python (1-2 lectures).
10. pycuda (1-2 lectures)
11. gpustats (1-2 lectures)
