a statistical model for phylogenetic trees:
 - continuous time markov chain

want to likelihood of a tree given the model and data. Then, we can do MLE to find the best tree given the data.





phylogoenetic computations can be time intensive:
  # possible trees explodes when # genetic sequences increases far enough

"Here we describe novel algorithms to make efficient use of the particular architecture of GPUs for the calculation of the likelihood of molecular sequence data under continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models of evolution. "


"Our algorithms build upon Silberstein et al. (2008), who demonstrate efficient on-chip memory caching for sum-product calculations on the GPU"



"to compute the likelihood of n aligned molecular sequences D given a phylogenetic tree τ with n tips and a CTMC model that characterizes sequence evolution along τ and allows for rate variation along the alignment."

"We then highlight two time-consuming steps in these approaches: (1) computing the probabilities of observing two specific sequences at either end of each branch in τ and (2) integrating over all possible unobserved sequences at the internal nodes of τ . Finally, we demonstrate how massive parallelization of these steps generates substantial speed-up in computing Pr (D)."
